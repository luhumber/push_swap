# Push_swap - 42 Project

## Description
Push_swap is a project at 42 School that involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. The goal is to implement an efficient algorithm to sort the stack with the fewest possible instructions.

## Radix Algorithm
The radix algorithm is a sorting technique based on the digits of numbers. In the context of Push_swap, this algorithm can be used to efficiently rearrange the stack. It works by performing multiple passes on the most significant digits, using stack manipulation operations to sort the elements.
